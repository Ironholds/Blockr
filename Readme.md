#Blockr
_Blockr_ is a set of R scripts that analyses blocking rationales on the English-language Wikipedia. In doing so, it attempts to divine data about increases or decreases in types of misbehaviour over time.

Interesting things found using the Blockr scripts will usually be posted on [my blog](https://blog.ironholds.org); if you spot a bug or have any suggestions, drop me a line.
